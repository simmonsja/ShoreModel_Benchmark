## CoSMoS-COAST-CONV model
### Model description
CoSMoS-COAST is a large-scale, long-term shoreline model integrating longshore and cross-shore transport, presented in Vitousek et al. 2017 [[1](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JF004065)], 2021 [[2](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005506)], 2023 [[3](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JF006936)].  The model presented in this particular submission (called "COSMOS-COAST-CONV") is an experimental, convolution-based version of the full CoSMoS-COAST model [[4](https://doi.org/10.5066/P95T9188)]. The manner in which the model uses discrete convolution operations to produce predictions of shoreline change will be described in an upcoming manuscript. 

The experimental COSMOS-COAST-CONV model uses the same, well-known CoSMoS-COAST model governing equation, which is given by:

$$ \frac{dY}{dt}=-\frac{1}{D_c} \frac{dQ}{dx}+\frac{Y_{\mathrm{eq}}-Y}{\tau}-\frac{c}{\tan\beta}\frac{dS}{dt}+v_{\mathrm{lt}} $$

where $$\frac{dY}{dt}$$ is the rate of change in the shoreline position $$Y$$, and the terms on the right-hand side represent (1) longshore transport, (2) wave-driven cross-shore (after Yates et al., 2009 [[5](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2009JC005359)] and Vitousek et al. 2021 [[2](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005506)]), (3) sea-level driven profile recession (i.e., the "Bruun rule"), and (4) a residual (linear) trend, respectively.  See references [[1](https://doi.org/10.1002/2016JF004065)], [[2](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005506)], & [[3](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JF006936)] for details on each model component.  An example of the dynamics of each shoreline component is shown in the figure below.

### Model implementation
The code of the experimental CoSMoS-COAST-CONV model is included with the submission.  

The model was applied to ***Task1.Short-term prediction***, ***Task2.Medium-term prediction***, and ***Task3.Long-term prediction***. For each transects individually, the model parameters were calibrated using wave ($H_s$, $T_p$, $\theta$) and smoothed shoreline data from 1940 to 2018 with a daily time step.  The calibrated model was then used to predict shoreline positions from 1940 to 2100, with given wave conditions.

The current, experimental model is calibrated using a constrained optimization routine ("fmincon" in Matlab and not the ensemble Kalman filter method of the published model) that minimizes the loss function  

$$ \mathcal{L_i} = \sqrt{(0-RMSE_{\mathrm{norm}})^2+(1-Corr)^2+(1-STD_{\mathrm{norm}})^2} $$

for each transect $$i$$, individually, where $$RMSE_{\mathrm{norm}} = \frac{RMSE_{\mathrm{pred}}}{STD_{\mathrm{targ}}}$$, $$STD_{\mathrm{norm}} = \frac{STD_{\mathrm{pred}}}{STD_{\mathrm{targ}}}$$, and 
$$Corr$$ are the normalized root mean square error, the normalized standard deviation, and the correlation coefficient, respectively. 

During the calibration period, the model obtains a respectable RMS error of ~5.4 m (when compared against the smoothed shoreline data and averaged across all transects).  

**Reqired external Matlab functions and toolboxes:**
