This folder should contain a submission from Kristen Splinter using an older version of ShoreFor with Ca, Ce, and Hb values. Calibration was only done using the available data and no adjustments were made for the points given in ~1950. Model was just run in through all wave data with no corrections applied to fit that data point.
