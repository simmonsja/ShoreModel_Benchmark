## Sea level datasets
- `sealevel_obs.csv`: Time series of observed sea levels between 1950 and 2018. 
- `sealevel_proj.csv`: Time series of projected sea levels under the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenario between 2019 and 2100.

Each of these files follows the same structure, below is the example for `sealevel_obs.csv`:
- **Year**: Years
- **Sealevel (m)**: Sea level rise (m) relative to local datum
